# Revolver Example: Knapsack
This example shows how Revolver can be applied to solve the Knapsack Problem.

## The Knapsack Problem
> The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a size and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total size is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.

## Credits
The example code was created by [Petr MÃ¡nek](https://github.com/petrmanek), Charles University, 2016.
[The sample problem instance](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/knapsack_01/knapsack_01.html) was provided by Florida State University.

## Dependencies

 - Revolver
 - Xcode 7.3
 - Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan *(perhaps this example can be ported to Linux?)*

## Usage

 1. Build and run the project in Xcode. *(don't use xcodeproj in this directory, use xcworkspace in the parent directory)*
 2. Hit the *Run algorithm* button.
 3. Observe the output generated in the log.
 4. Play around with `ProblemInstance.swift` to change the weights and values of things and observe how the output changes.
 5. Change parameters of the algorithm in `ViewController.swift` and observe how the output changes.

## Example Ouptut
When running this example, you should see similar output (provided that you don't change the seed or the problem instance).
