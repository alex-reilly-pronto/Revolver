  s.description = <<-DESC
  Revolver is a framework for building fast genetic algorithms in Swift 3.0.
  It supports tree-based and array-based chromosome structures, all common genetic operators,
  selections and terminations. It allows sequential and parallel processing.
  Everything listed is ready-to-run, yet easily extensible.
  By subclassing base classes and conforming to protocols, you can customize almost anything.
